"""Relation-graph traversal for visual novels.

A VN's `relations` field lists its directly related VNs, and those VNs list
theirs in turn, so the whole web of sequels/prequels/fandiscs/side stories that
a title belongs to is the connected component reachable from it. This module
walks that component breadth-first from a root VN and returns the nodes and
edges needed to draw a relation graph (mirroring VNDB's own /rg view).

Efficiency notes
----------------
* Local-first. Relations are stored on each VN row, so a frontier of ids is
  resolved with one batched local query per layer - no remote call when the
  component is already held locally.
* Remote fill. Ids the crawler has not reached yet are fetched from VNDB in
  batches and persisted, so the component can be completed and later traversals
  stay local.
* Bounded work. Traversal stops at GRAPH_DEPTH_CAP layers or GRAPH_NODE_CAP
  nodes and reports `truncated`, so a single huge component can neither explode
  the response nor stall the worker.
