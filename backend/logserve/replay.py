"""Replay a logged search — re-run the exact query a log entry recorded.

Two flavours, keyed on details['from'] (stamped by
vndb.search.common.log_search):

  - remote: re-POST the recorded {url, payload} to the VNDB Kana API and
    return the fresh HTTP status + body.
  - local:  re-execute the recorded compiled SQL (details['query']) against
    the vndb database and return the rows.

Replay does NOT go through the vndb search functions, so it does not itself
append a new log entry — it's a faithful re-issue of the captured request.
