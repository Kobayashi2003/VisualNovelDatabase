# Whole-app launcher. Boots three children and forwards Ctrl+C to all of them:
#   1. backend/launch.py via `pixi run` — Redis + Celery + the Flask servers,
#      inside the pixi env (run backend/scripts/pixi-setup.ps1 once first).
#   2. Next.js — the standalone server, or `next dev` under -Dev.
#   3. Caddy — the public ingress (frp forwards to -Bind, default :30709);
#      routes are in ./Caddyfile.snippet, upstreams from ./caddy-env.ps1.
#
# The edge lives here rather than in backend/launch.py because it fronts BOTH
# halves — routing /visual-novel-database to Next and /vndb, /imgserve, … to
# Flask. It is needed in dev too: `next dev`'s rewrites proxy the backend calls
# through it (see frontend/.env.local).
#
# Postgres is not spawned by anything — it runs as a Windows service
# (backend/scripts/pg-service.ps1). This script verifies it is up and accepting
# connections first, auto-starting the service if it is merely stopped.
#
# The frontend sits under a basePath rather than the origin root because a single
# public port may front several apps — run with -NoCaddy to let that shared
# gateway own the port instead. See AppGateway/.
#
# Usage:
#   .\start-prod.ps1                     # start with whatever is already built
#   .\start-prod.ps1 -Build              # `npm run build` first, then start
#   .\start-prod.ps1 -Dev                # dev stack (pixi run dev + next dev)
#   .\start-prod.ps1 -Clean              # delete frontend/.next first, then start
#   .\start-prod.ps1 -NoCaddy            # skip the edge (AppGateway owns the port)
#   .\start-prod.ps1 -NextPort 5005      # override the Next.js port
#   .\start-prod.ps1 -Bind :8080         # override the public port
#   .\start-prod.ps1 -SkipPgCheck        # skip the Postgres readiness check
#   .\start-prod.ps1 -PgServiceName foo  # check a differently-named PG service
