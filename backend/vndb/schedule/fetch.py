"""Data-fetching schedules for the VNDB resource database.

These jobs replace the random-sampling approach in schedule/random.py. The
VNDB Kana API (https://api.vndb.org/kana) is a paginated list API whose ids
are assigned sequentially, which makes two deterministic strategies possible:

  fetch_new_schedule      - walk the newest ids (sorted by id, descending) and
                            ingest anything not held locally, stopping as soon
                            as a page is fully known. In steady state this is
                            one cheap request per type per run.

  fetch_backfill_schedule - sweep the whole id space (sorted ascending) a few
                            pages per run, persisting a per-type page cursor so
                            every run continues where the last left off and the
                            historical gaps left by random sampling are filled.

Efficiency notes
----------------
* Batched reads. A page returns 100 entries in one request; ingestion fetches
  a whole batch of ids through a single comma-joined `id` filter (the API
  treats commas as OR) instead of one request per id.
* Live reads. The cached `search_remote` is bypassed on purpose - a fetch job
  must see fresh data, not an hour-old memoized page.
* List-driven. Ids come from the API's own listing, which only contains live
  entries, so deleted/never-assigned ids are never probed or retried.
* Bounded work. Each run is capped (MAX_NEW_PAGES / BACKFILL_PAGES_PER_RUN) so
  a scheduled run never blocks the scheduler thread for long.
* Correct conversion. Remote payloads pass through convert_remote_to_local
  before storage, dropping the relation-only fields the local schema lacks.
