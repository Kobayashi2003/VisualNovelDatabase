@dataclass
class ProcSpec:
    """Declarative description of one supervised child process.

    A spec is data — no side effects at construction time. The Supervisor
    reads the list, sorts by `depends_on`, and launches each as a
    subprocess.Popen with stdout/stderr merged into one pipe so the log
    pump thread can prefix every line uniformly.

    Fields:
      name         Unique identifier across the spec list. Doubles as the
                   default log prefix (uppercased).
      cmd          argv list for subprocess.Popen. Pre-resolve the binary
                   path (shutil.which) when the spec-maker also gates on
                   binary existence — avoids a second PATH lookup at spawn.
      depends_on   Names of other specs that must START before this one.
                   Not a readiness check — just ordering. If a referenced
                   name is absent from the spec list (e.g. its spec-maker
                   returned None because the binary was missing), the dep
                   is treated as already-satisfied so the rest still runs.
      cwd, env     Forwarded to subprocess.Popen as-is. Leave env=None to
                   inherit os.environ.
      log_prefix   Override for the log prefix (default: f"[{NAME}]").
      stop_cmd     Optional external command to request a graceful stop
                   (e.g. `pg_ctl stop -D <PGDATA> -m fast -w` for postgres).
                   Supervisor runs it synchronously, then waits up to
                   `stop_timeout` for the child to exit on its own. If the
                   child is still alive after that, Supervisor escalates to
                   terminate() and finally kill(). When None, Supervisor
                   skips straight to terminate() — fine for processes that
                   tolerate an abrupt TerminateProcess on Windows.
      stop_timeout Seconds to wait for the child to exit after the
                   graceful-stop request (or after terminate(), when
                   stop_cmd is None). Bumped above the default for
                   postgres because a "fast" shutdown still flushes WAL.
